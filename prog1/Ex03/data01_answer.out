a turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine,[1] which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.[2] despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.[3] "turing machine" from wikipedia.
